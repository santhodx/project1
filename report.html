<blockquote>Project 1 was announced in Septemper and every student had ample time to complete it. However, since there is no one answer to the question
    like other programming projects, I had to meticulously pay attention to every detail to make the website more appealing to the client.
    The long list of specification and a detailed rubric eased the process and guided thoroughly throughout the completion of project.
</blockquote>
 
<blockquote>  Here are the detailed breakdown of the work completion: </blockquote>
<div class="list">
<ol>
    <li>
        The website is developed for a client who is a the owner of the restaurant 'BBQ Nation'. This webiste serves as a mode to reserve a table,
        surf through the menu and gallery and also leave a feedback to the restaurant.
    </li>
    <li>
        The five html pages are index.html (home page), about.html (types and source of cuisines), menu.html (displays the menu), team.html
        (displays gallery of different special dishes prepared by our team), contact.html(a page for feedback)
    </li>
    <li>
        The header, navbar and the mobile-desktop display requirement was met with the help of lecture notes. Prof Chris Johnson had covered
        those topics during his lecture.
    </li>
    <li>
        All the styling (css) documents and images have been kept in different directories respectively called 'css' and 'images'. Since there is
        only a single js file, there aren't any directory for contact.js file.
    </li>
    <li>
        Images and alt descriptions are completed and are used in the 'gallery' button in the nav bar. In addition favicon is linked to all html pages.
        Restaurant logo is used as the favicon here. 
    </li>
        W3Câ€™s Nu Validator was used in the process of fixing minute errors which are not noticable when you host it. It helped clearing all the
        redundancies, errors and warnings.
    <li>
        The website contains more than two different fonts as mentioned in the specification. 
    </li>
    <li>
        The website provides form element where users are required to fill out the boxes and submit their feedbacks. It is in the 'contact.html'
        page. This invokes javascript function to provide a notification or alert depending on the completion of the form.
    </li>
    <li>
        Two external links provided are: a reservation website where you can book your tables, a YouTube channel of our sue chef Natasha Vlora
        where she goes through some amazing recepes. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Animation requiremen is satisfied in the 'about.html' page. Animation here is powered by CSS where you hover over an item, the name 
        leviates on y-axis and transform it's color from coral to orangle blood.
    </li>
    <li>
        The website is stored in gitHub and was consistantly updated and commited throughout since beginning. The link to the gitHib is:
